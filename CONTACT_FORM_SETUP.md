## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Form not submitting?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in `src/lib/supabase.js`
3. Ensure SQL table was created successfully
4. Check RLS policies are active

### No data appearing?
1. Go to Supabase → Table Editor
2. Check if table exists
3. Verify RLS policies (should allow INSERT for anon)
4. Check browser Network tab for failed requests
